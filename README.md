# Crafting Interpreters
This repository contains my working code from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

The book teaches you how to write interpreters for a toy programming language called Lox. At the end of each chapter, you have implemented some new observable functionality in our interpreter.

To more clearly show the progression from each chapter to the next, I've organized this repository with one directory for each chapter, each of which contains a complete copy of the implementation of the interpreter up to that point in the book. Each chapter's directory also contains a `README.md` file with some of my notes about the implementation up to that point.

### Chapter directories
