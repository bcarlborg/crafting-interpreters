# Crafting Interpreters
This repository holds the code for my implementation of the toy language, lox, as described in the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

The book teaches you how to write an interpreter over the course of some 30 odd chapters. At the end of each chapter, you have implemented some new observable functionality in the language. To more clearly show the state at the end of each chapter, this repository is organized with one directory for each chapter.

The directory for each chapter contains a complete copy of the implementation of the interpreter up to that point in the book. Each chapter's directory also contains a `README.md` file with some of my notes about the implementation up to that point.
