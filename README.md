# Crafting Interpreters
This repository holds the code for my copy of the code in the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

The repository is organized with one directory for each chapter. There is a `README.md` file in each chapter's directory with my notes on the implementation up to that point.
- [chapter 04: Scanning](./04-scanning/README.md)
- [chapter 05: Representing Code](./05-representing-code/README.md)
