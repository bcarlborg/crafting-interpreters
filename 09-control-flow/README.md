# Chapter 09: Control Flow
__This chapter is still a work in progress__

## Notes on implementation
**9.2 Conditional Execution**
- we add an if statement
    - this makes use of of the `statement` syntax rule rather than the declaration syntax rule that we created before
    - this ensure that the only way we can add variable declarations into our if statement is by adding a block statement as the
    arm of our if statement
- we create a syntactic if statement rule and we also create a new node type for our if statement and we include and optional if branch.
    - the syntactic node is composed of an expression condition along with a Stmt thenBranch and a Stmt elseBranch
    

**9.3 Logical Operators**
- add logical and and logical or

**9.4 While loops**


**9.5 For Loops**
